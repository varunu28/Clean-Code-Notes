# Clean-Code-Notes
Notes on the book Clean Code

## Names
 - If we require a comment to explain name of a variable, then it is not named correctly.
 - Pick a name that people can pronounce.
 - Avoid encodings while picking names i.e. a `string` name should not be named `nameStr` to display that it is a `string`.
 - Choose parts of speech well while picking names. `isSet` should logically return a `boolean` as it asks a question.
 - `Variables` with smaller scope should have smaller names while `variables` with longer scope should have longer names
 - It is opposite with `functions`. `Functions` with longer scope i.e. `public` should have smaller names as they are going to be called from multiple places.
 - `Functions` with smaller scope i.e. `private` should have larger names as they are going to be called from a smaller context.
 - Classes follow the same rules as that of functions in naming. 
 - Derived classes get appended with adjectives to display derivition. `Account -> SavingsAccount`.

## Functions
 - `if/else` chains in a function should be replaced with well-named predicate function.
 - Ideal function size should be 4-6 lines where additional logic should be further function calls.
 - If a function exceeds the ideal function size and has a lot of complicated logic then it should be transformed to a `class` with its own `invoke` method.
 - This `class` should be built of smaller functions that are called from `invoke` function.
 - Large functions are where classes go to hide!
 - As a part of refactoring functions in legacy code, rely on tests that check the behaviour of legacy code. Perform the refactoring in a `TDD` manner.
 - If a function is composed of multiple sections, its doing more than 1 thing. 
 - If a function manipulates more than 1 level of abstraction, its doing more than 1 thing.
 - In order for a function to do just one thing, it should not cross one level of abstraction.
 - If you are unable to extract a functionality from a function, then originally function was not doing just one thing.
 - Extract as long as you can extract no more i.e. `Extract till you drop`.

## Comments
 - Comments don't make up for bad code.
 - While adding a comment, always think if there is a way to avoid comment and make the code self explanatory.
 - Treat comment as a failure.
 - The only good comment is the comment you found a way not to write.
 - If you end up writing comment, try to ensure that the comment does not goes out of sync with the actual code in future iterations.
 - Comments can act as warning. If you want someone to not change a code or provide instructions for reuse of code, warning comments might come in handy.
 - `TODO` comments can be used to plan the future changes of the code. Make sure to scan the codebase regularly for `TODO` and put an effort to reduce `TODO` with each iteration.
 - Comments can be used to amplify changes that might seem minor to others such as `trim`, `length - 1` etc.
 - For public facing APIs, have a very clean and clear `docstring`. `Javadoc` for example.
 - Avoid redundant comments at all cost. A comment that provides no extra information in addition to reading the actual code should be removed.
 - A comment that contradicts the behavior of actual code should be considered misleading comment. They create confusion for anyone reading the code.
 - Always prefer for a scenario where you can remove a comment with a function call or a variable. 
```
// Check if customer is eligible for discount
if (customer.age > 25 && customer.salary > 20000 && customer.salary < 60000) 
                               
                               VS
                               
if (customer.isEligibleForDiscount()) 

                               OR 
                               
if (checkIfCustomerIsEligibleForDiscount(customer)
```
 - Don't have comments for things that can be taken care by a version control system. Ex: comments about author's name or date the change was added or commit hash
 - Don't have commented out code. Delete it and if required in future, you can fetch it from git based on the commit hash when it was deleted.
 - Add a comment as local to the code it describes. Don't describe global state in the comments.
 - Make sure the comments have a clear connection with the code. Your comment should not confuse the reader about the code.

## Formatting
 - Having badly formatted code gives an impression to the reader that other parts of the code will also have some hidden discrepencies.
 - Having a set rules of formatting for the project and an automated tool to enforce the formatting helps to maintain the codebase.
 - Prefer small size over larger files.
 - Consider the newspaper as an example for maintaining a file. The filename should be clear enough to give a high-level overview of what the code does. As we go down in the file the lower level details should be exposed in the linear order of file depth.
 - Use blank lines judicially to describe separation of concepts and new ideas in a code.
 - Lines of code that are tightly linked should appear together without any break such as a blank line or a comment.
 - Concepts that are closely related should be kept vertically close to each other.
 -  Variables should be declared as close to their usage as possible.
 -  Variables used for control of a loop should be declared as a part of their loop whenever possible.
 -  Instance variables should be defined at the starting of the class. Anyone reading the class definition should understand what variables does this class use before going to the functions the class describes.
 -  If one function calls another function then they should be vertically close to each other. Preferrabely the caller function should be above the function getting called.
 -  Functions with same **conceptual affinity** should be vertically close to each other. Conceptual affinity can mean functions calling each other, overloaded constructors or functions performing operations of similar behavior.
 -  Use hortizontal space to associate things that are closely related and disassociate things that are weakly related.
